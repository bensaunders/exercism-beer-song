# Beer Song

## Developer's comments

I read Metz & Owen's 99 Bottles book a couple of years ago,
so this solution is based on the lessons I took away from that reading:

* get the tests passing before worrying too much about code quality
* in real life, this might be all that's justified, because the extensibility
  and maintainability that comes with abstraction has a cost - complexity -
  that might not be worth paying.
* assuming that the code does need to be made more maintainable,
  gradually refactor your code by fixing one code smell at a time

Hopefully it goes without saying that this is an over-complicated solution
to a fairly simple puzzle! If this really was all we wanted to achieve, we
could do it much more simply. We're assuming that the puzzle is standing in
for a real-world problem, which would need to be worked on and extended by a
team of developers over a period of time, and which therefore deserves such an
in-depth treatment.

### Iteration 1

This is my "shameless green" iteration. All the tests pass, and the code does
a pretty good job of making it clear what the shape of the problem is:
most verses are of the same type, but there are a few exceptions.

### Iteration 2

This iteration is actually worse than before, in many ways. It's certainly less
easy to see at a glance what the code does. But it starts to uncover the exact
similarities and differences between the types of verse, and it gives names to
some of the component parts.

### Iteration 3

This iteration uses classes and inheritance to describe the different types of
verse. We no longer need to disable any style checks, and some of the clarity
is returning.

### Iteration 4

Here we just make a small change so that the Beer Song class doesn't have to
know which verse types are used for which numbers of bottles.

### Iteration 5 (current)

This iteration tackles some duplication in the verse. Each verse object does
some work to describe the number of bottles you start with, and the number that
are left after you drink them (or buy some more if need be). In fact, these are
really the same thing: a situation where a certain number of bottles of beer
are available. Or, to avoid baking the specific ideas of 'bottles' and 'beer'
into the code, a situation describing a certain amount of a certain substance;
a 'substance situation'. By moving most of the logic from the Verse into the
new SubstanceSituation class, the duplication is removed in a way that
describes the problem domain more accurately.
